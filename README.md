# R_Project
Here you can find a project based on my dissertation that demonstrates my skills in R programming, as well as statistical data analysis and data visualization.
I created an R Markdown file and then knitted it to an HTML file. The docs folder in this repository contains both of these files.
You can view the HTML file properly formatted and displayed at this link: https://tammyganster.github.io/R_Project/.
